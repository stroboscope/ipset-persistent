The Debian Package ipset-persistent
----------------------------

This is a very simple script that restores the file /etc/ipset/rules as
the active ruleset at system boot.

Loading of rules is guaranteed to happen before network interfaces are
brought up.

To save the current ruleset, use "ipset save >/etc/ipsetes/rules"
or "ipset save >/etc/ipset/rules", or
"invoke-rc.d ipset-persistent save"
